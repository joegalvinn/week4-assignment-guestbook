Hello sir/madame, 

please read my report m'lady

Obviously this one was going to be a hard one to get everything working. Mine works completely fine in my localhost, and i had the server running in the class friday, but i guess cause i've now got my app post/get stuff going on thats cause cors problems but i just can't get why. I have included the screenshot of my error in the inspect tab and i've run through multiple "fixes" that do nothing. I'm sure its going to be some small thing that i've just over looked but I can't find it. I was in a call with zak, kat and Ashir and then later talking to Cin on discord who is having a similar error.

Otherwise I feel similar to other projects where I have building blocks and i'm trying to make a skyscraper, I used a lot of similar website to help and lots of looking through manny's git repositories to help. I enjoyed making the css part of this one and made a pop up form which i think came out nicely. However when I then did my @media query above 600px i couldnt get the form to be visible. I could hide the button and position everything where i wanted but then couldn't get my form to fill the left hand side so I have left it as a button that then the pop up fills the space i'd have wanted it.
